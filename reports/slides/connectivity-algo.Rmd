```

## Idea

1. Downstream pass
    - Start at upstream-most node
    - connect all pixels that can be connected by moving downstream
    - Stop when no more downstream pixels remain
2. Upstream pass
    - Start at downstream-most node
    - connect all pixels that can be connected by moving upstream
    - Stop when no more upstream pixels remain
3. Conneted pixels are those that both passes connect


## Details

- Use modified along_reach distance from pixcvec
- Search 2 nearest neighbors in range/azimuth grid
    - Include down/upstream neighbors, discard others
- No longer recursive, much faster (~4 seconds for 68k pixels)
