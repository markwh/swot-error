## Intro

Session in 3 parts

1. Introduction/refresher on river products
2. Hands-on demonstration of simulated data products
3. Discussion 

## Follow the information

- Start with a satellite passing over the earth
- overlay right, left swath 
- highlight rivers from prior db
- What does the satellite see? 
  - Complex interferogram
  - multilook 
TODO: read relevant section in error budget, PIXC documents

- SLC is multilooked to produce pixel cloud
  - animation of SLC
- Multilooked pixels are geolocated
  - animation of pixc in slant coords geolocation to lat/lon
- Pixel cloud Processing (RiverObs)
  - pixcvec
  - nodes
  - reaches
- Pixel cloud is aggregated to nodes
  - Role of prior database
- Nodes are aggregated to reaches
  - Reach-specific fields
- Splitting into river tiles
- Formats 
  - all as netcdf
  - nodes and reaches as shapefiles
- Example workflow
  - Choose location, time of interest
  - Download tile for a selected pass
  - Work with tile data
  
- Overview of Sacramento River
  - Where's it fit in size distribution?
  - What passes go near it?
  - Where do simulated data (PIXC) come from?
    - hydraulic model


## Hands-on demo

### Objective: understand prior database

- Map of region
  - Use local tiles? TODO
  - a priori database: centerlines, nodes, reaches DONE
  - Click for all info in prior database?
    - This isn't a session on prior database!

### Objective: understand passes, tiles

- Map of region
  - paths of satellite for different passes (toggle) DONE
    - Click for pass number DONE
  - outlines of tiles (toggle) TODO
- Timeseries of x-track distance DONE
- Not all passes see all nodes!
- Select a tile, click "Get Data"
  - What should this do?
  - Static image, zoomable via [this method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26044171) or similar. POSSIBLY

### Objective: Understand file structure

- Files tab
  - For each run, put renamed netcdf and shapefiles into an individual folder. DONE
  - Table showing file name and size DONE
  - netcdf structure How to display? TODO
  - shapefile attribute table headers TODO

### Objective: Understand pixel cloud, pixcvec

- Show zoomable static image for pcv POSSIBLY
- Show a single reach's pixels in interactive map DONE
  - Slider to choose which reach is displayed DONE
  - click node for info (height, area, etc.) DONE
  - Legend for classification DONE
- Table of pixel data DONE
  - filter by pixel selection POSSIBLY

### Objective: Understand node product

- Select nodes on map
- Denote nodes not in tile
  - add stroke for in the tile?
- Filter table with node data
  - Toggle for basic, expert columns
 
### Objective: understand reach product

- Show reaches on map
- Show table with all reaches
- Show plots of height, width, slope, area
- Show regressions of node data 

### Objective: understand factors affecting measurement precision



### Objective: think critically about data contained in products

Questions for discussion

- Do any nodes' pixels surprise you? 
- Do the linear fits for nodes --> reaches seem reasonable?
- In what conditions would you be interested in using each tile? 
  - Are some passes better suited for 


## Summary

The following are **sections** of the UI

- header
- map
- table
- file viewer
- plots
- selection
  - tile, "get data"
  - reach (pixc display, node --> reach aggregation)
    - Possibly a range slider? 
  - Map display toggles
    - orbit tracks
    - tile outlines
    - nodes
    - centerlines/reaches
    - pixels (only once data is retrieved)
    
    
## Actions

- Click "get data"
  - bring up file names for this tile

## Required datasets

- orbits
- tiles?
- pixel clouds
- riverobs output
