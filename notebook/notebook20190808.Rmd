Today:

1. Prep for river processing telecon
2. Reorganize code--put stuff from notebook into src/ and lib/



### Prep for river processing telecon

- Show problem with area
  - qqplot, how to read
    - different phenomena
  - upshot at reach scale
- attempts at addressing water fraction uncertainty
  - outline of steps taken
  - resulting qqplots
  - best: original alpha hat, modified uncertainty
  - show resulting reach-level plots
- Attempts at addressing heavy tail
  - leaflet plots
- differentiate heavy tail from true outliers
- Next steps
  - Call water fraction good
  - get input on heavy tail
