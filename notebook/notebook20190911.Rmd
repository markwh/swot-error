Looking into an inconsistency in gdem WSE node accumulation: day 314, reach 7, GDEM refdem

```{r}
load("../cumerr-shiny/cache/rtnodes_master.RData")
load("../cumerr-shiny/cache/gdnodes_master.RData")



testrtnode <- rtnodes_master %>% glimpse() %>% 
  filter(run %in% c(88, 89), reach_id == 7, refdem == "GDEM")
testgdnode <- rtnodes_master %>% glimpse() %>% 
  filter(run %in% c(88, 89), reach_id == 7, refdem == "GDEM")

```


This may be due to the errors in these runs I found yesterday. Check into it when I get back home.
