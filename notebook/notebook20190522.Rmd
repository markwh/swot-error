```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Yesterday I got the passes read in; today work on tiles. 

Format is a little hard to understand. They only have 2 passes?

```{r}
tiles <- readr::read_delim("../data/tiles/tile-database-2018.txt", 
                           delim = " ",
                           col_types = "iinnn") %>% 
  setNames(c("pass", "tiles", "latitude", "longitude", "heading"))

tiles %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = pass))
  
```

Seems like a lot of work there. I don't doubt the information is in there, but now is not the time to do that. 


First get the .RData files for the passes.
