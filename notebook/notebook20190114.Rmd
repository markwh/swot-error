```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Using the reticulate package to test out SWOTWater aggregation functions.

```{r}
use_condaenv("RiverObs", required = TRUE)

water <- import("SWOTWater")
length(water)

str(water)

water$aggregate$area_only()
```

I know I need to use the `SWOTWater` module, but how that works with reticulate is unclear

Let's get some nodes and/or reaches from the toy case. 

```{r}
river <- import("SWOTRiver")

river$SWOTRiverEstimator(swotL2_file = )
```

Try in a python chunk.

```{python}
import SWOTRiver as sriver
```

Again, library issues with reticulate that aren't there with "native" conda. 

Working now with a standalone script. But I need to supply the arguments expected by the functions. Hang on, no use working with an outdated version. Update my RiverObs environment. OK, DONE.
