## This session

- Articulate objectives for uncertainty work
- Identify data sets to be used

## Motivation

- We estimate uncertainty in order to communicate expected precision to users.

- We validate uncertainty estimates in order to determine reliability of models that produce uncertainty estimates.

## Goals, objectives

- Model uncertainty to the extent it can be determined between features and times
  - One apprach: just use error budget as uncertainty estimate
	- We can do better!
- Validate uncertainty estimates against (synthetic) truth data in a representative sampling of conditions
    - Agreement should hold across different flow condtions, river morphologies, orientation and position in swath, etc.
    - If uncertainty estimates fail to capture error behavior, update error model accordingly, or flag
- Decompose errors into random (errors diminish predictably with aggregation) and systematic (diminish slowly or not at all)

## Current status

- Brent's models of random error for height, width, area are implemented in RiverObs
- Layover error model (Curtis) not yet implemented in RiverObs.
- Validated against nodes for a single case (Sacramento), single pass, 2 flow conditions

## Current status

```{r}
rt_valdata(dir5) %>% rt_val_hist(scale = TRUE, curve = TRUE,
                                 vars = c("height", "height2", "width", "area_total"))

```


## Datasets required

- Representative sampling of:
	- nodes
	- reaches
	- layover conditions
	- Reach geometry (meanders, etc.)
- All this can be done with SLC simulator!

## Open questions

- How to treat layover uncertainty in RiverObs?
- How to treat systematic errors in RiverObs?
    - Contstant from error budget?
- How to determine "truth" for purposes of uncertainty validation?
- Is it OK to overstate the uncertainty?

## Truth data matters

From an algorithm performance standpoint, truth is what we expect the algorithm to detect. 

- "practical" truth, not "ideal" truth
- Not trivial to produce this!

## Truth data example

```{r}
include_graphics("fig/sac_satellite1.png")
```

## Truth data example

```{r}
val_map_node(dir2, nodes = "451")
```

## Truth data example

```{r}
val_map_node(dir4, nodes = "451", pcv2 = "pcv_gdem_dil1.nc")
```


## Truth data example

```{r}
val_map_node(dir2, nodes = "451", pcv2 = "pcv_gdem_dil1.nc")
```



## Truth data example

```{r}
val_map_node(dir2, nodes = "329", pcv2 = "pcv_gdem_dil1.nc")
```


## Truth data example

```{r}
include_graphics("fig/sac_satellite2.png")
```

## Truth data

Current approach: flag out nodes with "unstable" truth values 

- Ignores hardest cases
- Overstates width, area accuracy
